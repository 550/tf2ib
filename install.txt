This project has been developped on Linux. The installation instructions have been tested on Linux. If you need a local IRC server I recommend you ngIRCD, I made a post about it there: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/144049/recommended-irc-server-ircd-for-a-small-site/990201#990201


1st step: configuring the database. I use PostgreSQL and I recommend it for this project.
----------------------------------------
su postgres // This command need to be run as root.
psql -c "CREATE USER tf2ib WITH PASSWORD 'jw8s0F4'"
psql -c "CREATE DATABASE tf2ib"
psql tf2ib < database.sql


2nd step: installing the necessary library and running the scripts. Before running those 2 scripts you need to change the value of some variabbles in the file "config.py"
----------------------------------------
aptitude install python-psycopg2 // You can use apt-get or yum, as long as you install properly the pyscopg2 library you are good to go.
./pug.py
./send.py PUG-MESSENGER // The second argument is the nickname of your messenger.
